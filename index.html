            <p>Did you know that your name is historically very significant? The ancient Indians  used to call the river we know as Indus as Sindhu . The Persians, living on the other side of the river, called it Hindu, as they had difficulties pronouncing 'S'. The Greeks, who came after the Persians, called it Indus, from which comes India. </p>

            <p>Sindhu,
              <br>
              Getting to know you has been nothing short of magical. Every moment spent with you has made my heart feel fuller, and the more I learn about you, the more you shine in my eyes. You’ve become so incredibly special to me, and I am so grateful to have you in my life. Our first date was one of the happiest days of my life, and I can’t wait to create countless more memories with you.
On your birthday, I wish you nothing but the purest happiness, and may all your dreams come true. You deserve the world, Sindhu, and I’m just so lucky to be a part of it. Thank you for being the beautiful, funny, and amazing person you are, and for lighting up my world every day.
To quote the great singer Jacques Bermon Webster II,     
"When I'm with you, I feel alive."💕💕💕💕</p>
